Use only 4:3 resolutions, otherwise stuff gets cut off (technically you can use taller but it will get letterboxed)

1. Download Ultimate ASI Loader d3d8.dll (https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/Win32-latest/d3d8-Win32.zip) and extract the d3d8.dll next to CSI3.exe
2. Download CSI3.HD latest release (https://github.com/jagotu/CSI3.HD/releases/latest) and extract the scripts folder next to CSI3.EXE
5. Modify scripts/CSI3.HD.ini with your desired resolution
